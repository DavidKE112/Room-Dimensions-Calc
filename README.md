# Room-Dimensions-Calc
This is what I have made in response to the software challenge on Borwell.com
To access the source code and the calculator you will need to open Calculator.sln in Visual Studios 2017.
This is my first time programming in this format so I apoligise if this appears abit basic. However if you have any advice on how I can improve it or add to it I will be very greateful.
